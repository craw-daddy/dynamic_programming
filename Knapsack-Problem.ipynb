    "We are given a collection, $T$, of $n$ items.  Item $i$ has weight $w_i$ and value $v_i$.  It's assumed that the weights and values are integers, and that these are all positive.  We have a _knapsack_ with a capacity $C$, i.e. it can hold a total weight $C$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to take the collection of items that together gives the maximum total value, without the total weight of the items exceeding the capacity $C$.  In mathematical terms, we want to find a subset $S \\subseteq T$ that maximizes the total value.  In other words, we want to find $S$ such that\n",

    "\n",
    "The \"0/1\" condition means that we are not allowed to take a fractional portion of any item, we have to either take an item or leave it behind.  (The Fractional Knapsack Problem allows us to take fractional portions of items.  That version has a greedy solution, which won't be discussed here.)  This \"0/1\" condition is what makes this problem \"hard\".  \n",

    "(Without going into any details of what this means, the 0/1 Knapsack Problem is an example of an [NP-complete problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness).
